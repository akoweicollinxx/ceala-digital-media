Most business owners waste time chasing leads one by one. They post on social media, respond to DMs, and hope someone buys. But that's not scalable. It's not even smart. Build a system that works for you around the clock and watch your business transform.

Make your winning funnel and transform your business. Your content system should capture attention, build trust, and guide people toward buying your products. Get this right and spend more time doing what you love. Open ChatGPT, copy and paste the prompts and keep the same chat window open so the context carries through.


**Create content that sells: ChatGPT prompts for leads every hour**

**1. Create a lead magnet**


You can't just send people straight from your social media to your homepage. That's a rookie mistake. Your website won't collect anywhere near as many email addresses as a well-planned lead magnet. So make one of those. Get ChatGPT's ideas for what would make a compelling lead magnet for your specific audience. Build it out and watch it fly.



"I need a lead magnet that converts social media followers into email subscribers. My target audience is [describe them] and they struggle with [describe their problems]. Ask me questions about my expertise and what I help people achieve. Then suggest 5 lead magnet ideas that solve a specific problem for my audience. For each idea, outline what to include and how to present it for maximum impact."



**2. Build a tripwire product**

There's a science to selling. Once someone has bought from you once, they become over 30 percent more likely to buy from you again. Nudge them along. A tripwire is a low-cost product that turns subscribers into buyers. Price it between $7 and $47 and make it irresistible. Solve one specific problem and get them results fast.



"Help me create a tripwire offer for my email subscribers. My main product is [describe it] and costs [price]. Ask me questions about what quick wins my audience needs. Then suggest 3 potential tripwire products under $50 that would naturally lead to my main offer. For each one, outline the key content and how to position it in a way that my audience would consider it a no-brainer to buy."


**3. Create your irresistible offer**

You’ve got the funnel in place and it’s nurturing them along to the main offer, adding value as they go. The first time they hear about your flagship product or service sets the tone for whether or not they buy. Make the offer abundantly clear. Value propositions, features and benefits, the transformation they should expect. Share success stories. Paint the picture of life after working with you. Give them reasons to believe that you can help them.


"Take everything you know about my business, audience and offer from our previous discussion and help me craft an irresistible offer. Ask me questions about what makes my offer unique, the results my clients achieve, and who they become after working with me. Then create a compelling offer that includes the key benefits, features that matter most to my audience, proof points from past client successes, and responses to common objections. Package this into clear, persuasive copy that builds desire and urgency, ending with a strong call to action that makes them want to buy now. Focus on the transformation they'll experience and paint a vivid picture of life after using my product or service."

**4. Run a valuable webinar**

If you're great on camera, get on camera. Teach your audience something valuable, share all the golden nuggets, then make your sell at the end when you share your irresistible offer. It will feel salesy to you, but they'll be all ears. A webinar builds trust and authority while qualifying buyers. Your job is to give them a taste of success and show them how to get more.


"Design a webinar structure that educates and sells my offer throughout and at the end, in a way that doesn’t feel cringe to me. Using what you know about my expertise and the transformation I help my clients achieve, create an outline for a 60-minute webinar that delivers real value while naturally leading to my offer. Include hooks, stories, and teaching points to keep viewers engaged."


**5. Write effective emails**

Your list is building. Now talk to them. Once the funnel steps are in place, well-crafted emails will bridge the gap between prospects and customers. The return on investment of email marketing is around 4,200%, so grab a slice of that pie. Follow a proven email structure, such as problem, agitation, solution, and write emails that make readers feel understood before presenting your solution. Schedule them up so they send without you hitting the button.


"Create an email sequence for my new subscribers who [downloaded/engaged with] my lead magnet, [describe it]. My goal is to build trust and eventually sell my main offer, which you now understand. Outline 3 emails, following a problem, agitation, solution series, that take subscribers from interested to ready to buy, using sales psychology and email marketing best practice. Include subject lines and key points for each email."


**Build authority with content: ChatGPT prompts to sell while you sleep**

Set up your content system and let it work its magic, funnelling potential customers right through to a sale. Create a lead magnet your audience wants, build a tripwire that turns subscribers into entry level buyers, and create your irresistible main offer. Then, run webinars that sell and write emails that engage and convert. Your autopilot sales system starts now. You’ll wonder why you didn’t do it sooner.

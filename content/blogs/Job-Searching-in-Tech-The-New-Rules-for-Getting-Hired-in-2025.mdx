**1. Figure Out Your “Candidate Market Fit.”**
---
---
Have you ever felt like you’re trying to fit a square resume into a round…job description? It’s normal to feel that way in industries (I’m looking at you, tech!) that are always changing. I’ll say it now and I’ll say it again — give up on the word “perfect.” The real trick to finding the right job isn’t about finding the “perfect” job. It’s about finding the right fit for you in today’s job market. That’s where Phyl Terry’s idea of ‘candidate market fit’ comes in clutch.

Instead of obsessing over a job title that’s “perfect” for you, focus on understanding what roles you’re actually a good fit for. The tech job market is always evolving, so what you thought was your dream job a year ago might not even be on the radar anymore. How do you figure out what jobs are out there? Research.

**2. Create a “Good Enough” Resume.**

There’s no such thing as the “perfect” resume, but you can make it “good”. Good is subjective, so consider your industry and what information you’d like to communicate right away. If you can believe it, recruiters only spend about 7.4 seconds scanning a resume(opens in a new tab), so you need to hook them quickly. And what’s the first thing they notice? Layout and design.
Note: By the way, we’re not talking highly-designed unless your industry calls for it.
f you’re new in tech, aim for one page. If you’ve got 10+ years of experience, two pages are probably necessary. Regardless of length, make it easy to skim — keep it portrait-oriented with clear headings for each section.

As for design, go for clean and legible fonts. Sans serif fonts like Arial or Calibri may look plain, but they’re perfect for tech applications where you’ve got a few seconds to impress someone. And don’t let your text blend into the background. You want high contrast between the text and background — go for a light-colored background (preferably white) and black font.


**3. Don’t Spray and Pray.**

When job hunting in tech, it’s easy to fall into the “spray and pray” trap — applying to every job that crosses your screen just to get some responses in your inbox. But trust me, that’s a recipe for burnout. This is a job hunt, not the lottery, so it makes sense to put some more thought into it, even if it feels like you’re not applying to ‘enough’ jobs. Yes, you want to cast a wide net, but don’t apply just for the sake of applying. Make sure the roles align with your interests and experience. Make sure it’s a job you actually want.


**4. Negotiate.**
---
---

Job applications aren’t exactly a walk in the park, and let’s be real — negotiating your offer is probably the most awkward part of the process. Sure, the money matters — more than almost anything else — but so do the perks that help you grow in your career. Think mentorship, access to training programs, or even the opportunity to attend industry conferences. Ask about these, too! These things — as experience and lines on your resume — can have a huge impact on your long-term growth and career. It’s not only about squeezing out the highest salary, it’s also about setting yourself up for success.

When you’re in negotiation mode, remember it should be a conversation, not a power struggle. Sure, you’re not there to make demands, but you can definitely ask, “Is this something you’re open to?” If they say no, that’s cool — at least now you’ve got all the facts and can decide whether the offer still works for you.

Before you dive into negotiations, do your homework. Understand the company, the role, and the job market you’re dealing with. Research how much the company pays its employees, the average salary for the role you’re applying to, and whenever possible, external factors like the overall state of the job market. That way, you’re not walking in blind, and you’ll be in a better position to gauge whether the offer is fair or if they’re trying to lowball you.


**5. Don’t Job Search Alone.**
---
---

Look, the companies hiring in tech aren’t going at it alone, so why should you? Behind every job posting is a team of people — recruiters, hiring managers, HR reps, etc., all working together to make sure the process runs smoothly. You shouldn’t have to go it alone. If you don’t have a community of support yet, start building one.  

Consider joining a job search council(opens in a new tab) — a group of peer job seekers who can offer support, share insights, and hold each other accountable. You want to find people on the same page as you: motivated, optimistic, and ready to tackle the job search. You also need mentors. Find someone with a job you want or an inspiring career path, and reach out. Make it low-stakes and try to ask for a conversation, not a job.


**6. It’s Not (Always) You. Sometimes it’s the Job Market.**
---
---

If you’re finding it hard to land a tech job right now, don’t beat yourself up — it’s not just you, we promise. The job market is a bit of a mess these days. There’s a flood of talent out there, especially with layoffs bringing a lot of highly skilled people back into the running. The economy has had some wins, but we’re still waiting for that shift back in tech’s direction. It’s tough out there, and it’s not necessarily a reflection of your skills or abilities. It’s about timing, and sometimes it’s not your fit, but the market that’s the issue.
